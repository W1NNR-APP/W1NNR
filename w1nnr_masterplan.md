# W1NNR Master Plan

## Vision
The social gaming network for amateur athletes. 
Tinder for competitive sports. LinkedIn for your sports career.

## Target Market
- 25M amateur golfers in US
- 22M recreational tennis players
- Focus: 0.1% capture = 47,000 users

## Core Features (MVP)
1. User signup (email/social)
2. Create match (sport, location, stakes in USDC)
3. Join match (browse nearby, ELO-matched)
4. Play match (IRL)
5. Report outcome (both players confirm)
6. Payout (winner gets 90% USDC via smart contract)
7. ELO ranking (updates after each match)

## Token Economics
- Users stake USDC (stable)
- Platform takes 10% fee
- Smart contract swaps USDC → W1NNR
- Creates buy pressure on W1NNR
- Platform accumulates W1NNR treasury
- W1NNR holders get fee discounts + governance

## Tech Stack
- Blockchain: PulseChain (low gas)
- Contracts: W1NNR token + USDC escrow
- Backend: Node.js + PostgreSQL
- Frontend: React Native (mobile-first)
- Auth: Privy (email → wallet)
- Payments: MoonPay (fiat → USDC)

## Launch Plan
- Month 1: Validate (landing page + ads)
- Month 2: Smart contracts + backend API
- Month 3: Mobile app MVP
- Month 4: Beta launch (50 users, San Diego)
- Month 5-6: Iterate, improve, scale

## Key Metrics
- User signups
- Match volume (monthly)
- USDC flowing through platform
- W1NNR price appreciation
- User retention rate

## 🚀 **Your Mantra**

Every time you sit down to work:

> "Am I making this smoother, cleaner, cooler, or smarter?
> Will this help amateur athletes compete and get recognized?
> Does this move me closer to launch?"

If NO → don't build it yet.
If YES → go hard.
